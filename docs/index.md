# Pioupiou for Developers

Welcome to the Pioupiou developers portal.

From the inception, Pioupiou was built with the idea of making its data available in an open and easily reusable way.

We believe that the value is not the data, but the innovative uses **you** will create from it.

## Widgets

For easy integration on your website:

* [Widgets]

## API endpoints

For advanced use:

### Measurements
* [Live]: latest measurements
* [Archive]: historical data
* [Push]: real-time feed using [Socket.IO]

## License

To use data from Pioupiou stations, you must comply with the license available on the [Data Licensing] page.

[Widgets]: widgets.md
[Live]: api/live/index.md
[Archive]: api/archive/index.md
[Push]: api/push/index.md
